# Leveraging Claude for Agentic Coding & Product Development

Claude is a powerful AI assistant from Anthropic that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including software development. This guide provides best practices for using Claude, particularly its agentic coding capabilities, to build high-quality products efficiently.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that operates directly within your terminal. It has a deep understanding of codebases, can plan and execute multi-step tasks, and integrates with your existing development workflow.

### Key Features:

*   **Codebase Awareness:** Claude can map out and understand your entire project, including its structure and dependencies.
*   **Agentic Capabilities:** You can give Claude a high-level goal, and it will autonomously plan the steps, execute them, verify the results, and even fix its own mistakes.
*   **In-Terminal Operation:** Claude works alongside your favorite IDE and development tools in the command line.
*   **Task Automation:** It can handle a variety of tasks, including:
    *   Editing, refactoring, and documenting code.
    *   Fixing bugs and resolving missing dependencies.
    *   Running tests and linting commands.
    *   Integrating with Git for version control.

## Best Practices for Agentic Coding with Claude

To get the most out of Claude's agentic capabilities, follow these best practices.

### 1. Provide Clear Context with `CLAUDE.md`

Create a file named `CLAUDE.md` in the root directory of your project. Claude reads this file to understand project-specific information, such as:

*   **Core files and their purpose.**
*   **Coding style guidelines and repository etiquette.**
*   **Commonly used shell commands and testing instructions.**
*   **Instructions on how to approach specific problems.**

You can also use this file to make Claude aware of your custom scripts and tools.

### 2. Adopt a Structured Workflow

A structured approach to interacting with Claude leads to better outcomes. The recommended workflow is **Explore → Plan → Code → Commit**.

1.  **Explore:** Start by asking Claude to read relevant files and understand the existing codebase. Explicitly tell it *not* to write any code at this stage.
2.  **Plan:** Ask Claude to create a step-by-step plan for the task. For complex problems, you can use phrases like "think harder" to encourage a more robust plan.
3.  **Code:** Once you approve the plan, instruct Claude to implement the solution.
4.  **Commit:** After verifying the changes, you can ask Claude to commit the code with a descriptive message.

### 3. Embrace Test-Driven Development (TDD)

A powerful way to work with Claude is to follow a TDD workflow:

1.  Ask Claude to write failing tests that a new feature requires.
2.  Commit the failing tests.
3.  Instruct Claude to write the code to make the tests pass.

This ensures that the code meets the requirements and is well-tested.

### 4. Master Effective Prompting

The quality of your prompts directly impacts the quality of Claude's output.

*   **Be Specific and Clear:** Provide detailed and unambiguous instructions. Instead of "make it look modern," say "use a design similar to the Linear app's UI."
*   **Provide Examples:** For complex or nuanced tasks, providing examples of the desired input and output can significantly improve results.
*   **Manage Context:** For long conversations, the context can become cluttered. Use the `/clear` command to start fresh between distinct tasks.
*   **Use Visuals and URLs:** Claude can process images and fetch content from URLs. You can provide screenshots for UI development or links to documentation.

### 5. Employ Advanced Techniques

For more complex scenarios, consider these advanced strategies:

*   **Multi-Claude Workflows:** Use multiple instances of Claude to work on a single problem. For example, one Claude instance can write the code, while another can review it, simulating a developer and a code reviewer.
*   **Headless Mode for Automation:** Claude Code can be run in a non-interactive "headless" mode, which is useful for automating tasks in a CI/CD pipeline.
*   **IDE Integration:** Use the official Claude Code extension for Visual Studio Code for a more integrated experience.

## Building Products with Claude Agents

Claude agents can be used to build a variety of products, from customer-facing applications to internal productivity tools.

### Key Capabilities for Product Development:

*   **Complex Reasoning:** Claude models can handle multi-step problems and complex analysis.
*   **Tool Use:** They can interact with external tools and APIs to perform actions.
*   **Code Generation and Execution:** Claude can generate and execute Python code in a sandboxed environment for tasks like data analysis and visualization.
*   **Document Analysis:** Agents can process and summarize documents, extract information, and handle large amounts of text.

### The PACT Framework

The PACT framework provides a structured workflow for building with agents:

*   **Prepare:** Define the problem and gather the necessary resources.
*   **Architect:** Design the system and the agent's role within it.
*   **Code:** Implement the solution, using Claude for assistance.
*   **Test:** Thoroughly test the system to ensure it meets the requirements.

By following these best practices and leveraging Claude's powerful features, you can accelerate your development process and build better products.

## Recommended Tools for Expo React Development

When using Claude for Expo React development, you can instruct it to use the various command-line tools available in your environment. These are the "tools" that Claude can leverage to build, test, and run your application.

### Expo CLI

*   `npx expo start`: Starts the development server.
*   `npx expo install <package-name>`: Installs a library compatible with your project's Expo SDK.
*   `npx expo doctor`: Diagnoses and helps fix common issues.
*   `npx expo prebuild`: Generates the native `android` and `ios` directories.
*   `npx expo run:android`: Builds and runs the app on an Android device or emulator.
*   `npx expo run:ios`: Builds and runs the app on an iOS device or simulator.

### EAS (Expo Application Services) CLI

*   `eas build`: Creates a build of your app for development, preview, or production.
*   `eas update`: Creates and publishes an over-the-air (OTA) update.
*   `eas submit`: Submits your app to the app stores.

### Testing

*   `npm test` or `yarn test`: Runs unit and component tests with Jest.
*   `npm test -- -u` or `yarn test -u`: Updates Jest snapshots.
*   `detox build --configuration <config>`: Builds the app for Detox E2E testing.
*   `detox test --configuration <config>`: Runs Detox E2E tests.
*   `maestro test <flow-file.yaml>`: Runs E2E tests with Maestro.

### Debugging

*   Press `j` in the terminal running `npx expo start` to open React Native DevTools.
*   Use `console.log()` statements in your code to print logs to the terminal.

## Using Claude in Headless Mode

Claude Code can be run in a non-interactive "headless" mode for automation and scripting. This is activated using the `-p` flag, followed by a prompt.

`claude-code -p "Your prompt here"`

### Key Flags and Options:

*   `--output-format json` or `--output-format stream-json`: For easier parsing of results in scripts.
*   `--allowedTools <tool1>,<tool2>`: Explicitly grant tool permissions.
*   `--dangerously-skip-permissions`: Bypass permission checks for long-running tasks.

### Example Use Cases:

*   **Automated Documentation:** Create a pre-commit hook that uses Claude to automatically add documentation to new functions.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Use Claude in your CI/CD pipeline to run tests, analyze logs, or perform other automated tasks.
*   **Batch Processing:** Automate large-scale code migrations or analysis.
