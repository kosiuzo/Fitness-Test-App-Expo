**Sample Conversation Flow**:
```
User: "I have 45 minutes and want to focus on upper body"
AI: "Great! What equipment do you have available?"
User: "Just dumbbells and a bench"
AI: "Perfect. What's your experience level with dumbbells?"
User: "Intermediate"
AI: "I'll create a 45-minute upper body dumbbell workout for you..."
```

### 7. Real-time Workout Adjustments
**Purpose**: Modify workouts during execution

**Mid-Workout Modifications**:
- "This is too easy, make it harder"
- "I'm running out of time, can we speed this up?"

## User Experience Features

### 8. Workout Explanation & Education
**Purpose**: Help users understand workout design rationale

**Educational Elements**:
- Why specific exercises were chosen
- How the workout targets stated goals
- Form tips and safety considerations
- Expected difficulty and duration
- Modification suggestions

**Example Explanation**:
```
"I've designed this workout to target your chest, shoulders, and triceps 
in 45 minutes. We'll start with compound movements (dumbbell press) to 
build strength, then move to isolation exercises (flyes) for muscle 
definition. The rep ranges (8-12) are optimal for muscle growth."
```

### 9. Workout Rating & Feedback
**Purpose**: Improve AI recommendations through user feedback

**Feedback Collection**:
- 1-5 star rating system
